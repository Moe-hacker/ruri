# Enhance Container Security

Here are several ways to enhance the security of ruri container, kindly read this document before using ruri.

## Regular

### Run rootless container

If your device supports user ns, you can install uidmap and use `-r` option with common user, so that you can avoid using root privileges to run the container.

### Run command in container with common user

If you can not run rootless container, there's another choice, add a common user in your container and use `-E username` to run command as common user instead root.
If you don't need any privileges, it's better to enable no_new_privs at the same time.

### Hidepid

ruri supports hidepid options for /proc, use `-i 1/2` to enable it.

### Capabilities

Ruri will automatically drop unneeded capabilities, but ruri also provides capability control function, you can read capabilities(7) and use `-d` option to filter out unnecessary capabilities in container.

### Disable .rurienv

Ruri will create the file /.rurienv in container, to avoid security issues, this file is immutable and read-only.
But you can also disable creating it using `-N` option.

### Set memory limit

Ruri supports memory cgroup, you can use `-l` option to set the limit of memory usage.

### Enable unshare

Ruri supports unshare, it's recommended to enable this feature for better security.
Unshare container will use pivot_root(2) instead chroot(2), so it's more secure.

### Mount other mountpoints as read-only

Ruri supports using `-m` option to mount other device/img/dir into container, if you only need read access to the mountpoint, try using `-M` option to make them read-only.

## Geek

### Seccomp

Ruri has a built-in Seccomp profile, you can enable it by using `-s` option.
If this profile does not fit your needs, you can edit src/seccomp.c and write your own Seccomp rules.

### Deny syscall

If you just want to deny a syscall, you can use `-X` option, this will just set SCMP_ACT_KILL for this syscall.
For example: `-X unshare -X chroot`.

## Radical

### No new privs

Ruri supports enable no_new_privs bit by `-n` option, after enabling this, command like `sudo` will be unavailable for common user.

### Mount / as read-only

Ruri supports mounting the rootfs of container as read-only by using `-R` option, this will make all the container read-only.

### Do not create runtime dirs

/dev, /proc and /sys will not be mounted if you enable `-j` option.

### Disable network

You can use `-x` option to create a new net ns and disable network for container.
